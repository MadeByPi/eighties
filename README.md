Hello, my name is Eighties
==========================

As a simple, modern and progressively enhanced WordPress theme, I take your content and make it pop. For far to long we have distracted our readers with, advertisements, popups and other junk. Letâ€™s get back to basics and give the readers what they came for: content.

You can learn more about me on [the site that my maker built](http://eighties.me).

If I could get a tattoo, it would say [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

Installation
============

Well, this depends on you. If you have a self hosted WordPress site, then I would recommend downloading me from the WordPress.org repo on your site's theme admin page.

If your site is on WordPress.com, then I honestly don't know why you would be viewing this project Github (unless you want to contribute). You should go to your site and shout out my name! Oh, and by 'shout out', I mean 'search for'. :)

Contribute

Hey, nobodys perfect. If you see something wrong with me, or simply want to make me better, do not hesitate to submit an issue or pull request.
