Eighties is a modern theme mean for use to bring your writing to center stage. It boasts a navigation and sidebar overlay, powered 90% by CSS but enabled by JavaScript. Don't worry, Eighties works completely with JavaScript too (just for funsies).

Notice
======

Eighties is still a work in progress, but is relatively safe for use on a live site. I'll have an offical release soon.

Installation
============

- Download and install via WordPress theme admin page.
- Clone the Github repo.
- Download directly from WordPress.org (coming soon).
